# Cellular Network Coverage Analyzer
Cellular Network Coverage Analyzer is a Python-based command-line tool designed to analyze the coverage of a cellular network in a given area. The project reads a JSON file containing data about base stations, antennas, and the geographical points they cover. Users can generate global statistics on network coverage, display detailed information about specific base stations, and check coverage for a given location. The tool offers insights such as the number of covered areas, overlap between antennas, and coverage gaps.

This project simulates real-world telecommunications analysis, providing hands-on experience in geospatial data handling and statistical analysis.

Features

* Global Coverage Statistics: View overall network performance, including total base stations, antennas, and areas covered.
* Base Station Analysis: Analyze coverage statistics for individual base stations, with details on antenna performance and coverage overlap.
* Coverage Check: Input custom coordinates to check if a specific point is covered, and if not, find the nearest antenna with relevant signal strength.
* Command-line Interface: Run the program from the terminal, passing the JSON file as input and interacting through a menu-driven interface.
